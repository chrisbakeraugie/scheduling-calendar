Calendar Use:

To create new times, use the form to select a day and start/end times.
If these times overlap with existing times, they will combine with those times; there are no layers of availability.
    Either the availability is separated by an hour or they will combine into one larger time block.
To delete a time, click on the block and selected "Delete" on the prompt box.


To see its abilities in a simple responsive form, narrow the window to 500px or less and the app will reformat to the small area.
